# Scheduler

## Description

We were tasked with creating a work day scheduler featuring dynamicaly updated html and css. The scheduler was required to display the current date and time. Each hour of the work day is displayed as a timeblock. Each timeblock was required to be color coded based on whether it is in the past, present, or future. Events can be entered into each of the timeblocks, and could be saved using the save buttons. Once an event is saved it is saved to local storage, and will persist when the page is refreshed.
